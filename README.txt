In order to run my code, the MATLAB spline toolbox has to be installed, and the files 
bary.m and baryWeights.m have to reside in the same directory.

There are two .m files in my submission:

1. Part1_interpolation.m
    
    Contains the implementation of the interpolation methods. 
    Running this file will produce most of the plots used in my report and display all the
    calculated errors in the terminal. 
    The file produces a total of 8 plots and may take a moment to run.


2. Part2_timing_errors.m

    Contains the solution to question 5 of the assignment. 
    The implementation of the algorithms is identical to the ones in Part1, but 
    this file includes additional logic to implement functions "tic" and "toc". 
    Running this file will produce the plots of errors and times for each of 
    the methods.
